1 IMPORTANT

Make sure that you have legally bought a copy of Monkey Island Special Edition.

2 HOW TO USE THE CODE

The code must be compiled before it can run. It was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Pro but other versions and IDE's will probably be able to compile it as well.
The file Program.cs contains the entry point for the application. Inside you will find references to specific game files and logic of the general behaviour of the application.
You must place the original artwork from the game in PNG format into the art folder in order for the Renderer class to work.

3 WHAT NOT TO COMMIT

Do NOT commit any original unaltered files from the Monkey Island games or other copyrighted material.
