================================
FIRST USE
================================
Before use you must copy the PNG costume artwork to the art folder keeping the same folder hierarchy as exported.


================================
WHERE DO I FIND THE ARTWORK?
================================
Have you not yet exported the artwork from the game you can do that using MISE Explorer which can be downloaded here

Export all the costume as DDS as the PNG export option ignores transparency.


================================
HOW DO I CONVERT THE ARTWORK FROM DDS TO PNG?
================================
I use Paint.NET but other image editors can probably also do it. Paint.NET is free and can be downloaded here
