Change Room and Costume parser to use the new binary loader.... you know... the one LPAK uses

There is something with the DXT to DDS conversion I think. Look at the bar room; there are artifacts at the lower right of each 1024px

Finish the room parser

Improve costume support

Implement ExportRoomToPngCommand

Add context menu to level 2 tree nodes so HEX view is available
